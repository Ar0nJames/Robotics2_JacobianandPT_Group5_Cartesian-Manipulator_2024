## Abstract üóÉÔ∏è
<a name="abstract"></a>
<div align="center">
  <p>In this article, we will discuss the Cartesian Manipulator, detailing all of its components. Also known as a rectilinear or gantry robot, a Cartesian Manipulator operates using the Cartesian coordinate system and features three linear joints (or a combination thereof) along the X, Y, and Z axes.</p>

  <p>Later in the article, we will delve into topics such as the Jacobian Matrix, Differential equations and the Path and Trajectory of the Cartesian Manipulator. Included are some description, computaion and videos related to these topics to aid in clarification and understanding.</p>

**The Jacobian Matrix** is a fundamental tool in the analysis of small signal stability within robotic systems. It is defined as a determinant for a finite number of functions, each involving the first partial derivatives of the same function with respect to the variables. This matrix establishes a relationship between the joint variables and the end-effector velocities of a robot's manipulator. When the joints of the robot move with certain velocities, the Jacobian Matrix helps determine the corresponding velocity of the end-effector. Its primary use is in finding the transformation coordinates, making it essential for understanding the dynamics of robotic motion.

## Path and Trajectory Planning of Cartesian Manipulator
<a name="path-and-trajectory-planning"></a>
**Path planning and trajectory planning** are critical aspects of robotics and automation. The trend toward higher operating speeds in robotic systems aims to reduce production times, but this can impact the accuracy and repeatability of robot motions. High-speed operations demand exceptional performance from actuators and control systems, making it essential to generate smooth trajectories that minimize excessive accelerations and mechanical vibrations. Path planning algorithms create a geometric path from an initial to a final point, passing through pre-defined via-points, while trajectory planning algorithms assign time information to these paths. The careful timing of these trajectories is crucial, as it influences both the kinematic and dynamic properties of the robot's motion.
