## I. Abstract of the Project

  In this article, we will discuss the Cartesian Manipulator and its various components. Also known as a rectilinear or gantry robot, the Cartesian manipulator operates using the Cartesian coordinate system. It is characterized by three linear joints, corresponding to the X, Y, and Z axes.

Later in the article, we will cover topics such as calculating degrees of freedom, Denavit-Hartenberg notation, the Jacobian matrix, inverse kinematics, and the path and trajectory of the Cartesian manipulator. To aid in understanding these concepts, we have included videos that clarify and elaborate on the topics discussed.
